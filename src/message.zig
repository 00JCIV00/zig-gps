/// A TPV object is a time-position-velocity report. The "class" and "mode" fields will reliably be present. When "mode" is 0 (Unknown) there is likely no usable data in the sentence. The remaining fields are optional, their presence depends on what data the GNSS receiver has sent, and what gpsd may calculate from that data.
/// 
/// A TPV object will usually be sent at least once for every measurement epoch as determined by the "time" field. Unless the receiver has a solid fix, and knows the current leap second, the time may be random.
/// 
/// Multiple TPV objects are often sent per epoch. When the receiver dribbles data to gpsd, then gpsd has no choice but to dribble it to the client in multiple TPV messages.
/// 
/// The optional "status" field (aka fix type), is a modifier (adjective) to mode. It is not a replacement for, or superset of, the "mode" field. It is almost, but not quite, the same as the NMEA 4.x xxGGA GPS Quality Indicator Values. Many GNSS receivers do not supply it. Those that do interpret the specification in various incompatible ways. To save space in the output, and avoid confusion, the JSON never includes status values of 0 or 1.
/// 
/// All error estimates (epc, epd, epe, eph, ept, epv, epx, epy) are guessed to be 95% confidence, may also be 50%, one sigma, or two sigma confidence. Many GNSS receivers do not specify a confidence level. None specify how the value is calculated. Use error estimates with caution, and only as relative "goodness" indicators. If the GPS reports a value to gpsd, then gpsd will report that value. Otherwise gpsd will try to compute the value from the skyview.
